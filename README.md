## Project Overview
The Common Emitter BJT amplifier is renowned for its ability to amplify voltage, making it a cornerstone in electronic circuit design, particularly in applications requiring signal amplification. Our project aimed to design an amplifier that meets specific performance criteria, including a voltage gain of 180 and a bandwidth for the low pass filter of 5.5 MHz. These parameters were chosen to demonstrate the amplifier's efficiency and responsiveness in a controlled setting.

## Research and Design
Our approach began with a comprehensive study of the BJT's properties and the various amplifier configurations. The common emitter configuration was selected for its high voltage gain and phase inversion properties, which are ideal for our application needs. We explored different biasing techniques and stabilization methods to ensure the amplifier's operation remains stable across different temperatures and variations in transistor parameters.

## Circuit Implementation
The practical phase involved constructing the amplifier circuit on a breadboard, followed by rigorous testing to refine the design. We used simulation software to model our predictions and compare them with actual measurements, allowing us to make necessary adjustments. The design process was iterative, with each cycle bringing us closer to achieving our specified gain and bandwidth
